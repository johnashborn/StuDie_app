📚 StuDie — Your Student Buddy App
Hey there! 👋
StuDie is a personal side project I’m building to make student life just a little easier.
Think of it as your academic sidekick—packed with useful tools to help you study smarter, not harder.
Because let’s be honest... no one wants to study harder 😤

🚀 Current Features
📸 Camera Calculator
Snap a photo of a math problem and let the app solve it for you.
Uses OCR to read expressions and evaluates them using exp4j.
Fast, simple, and honestly... it still blows my mind how it works.

📄 DOCX/Text to PDF Converter (WIP upgrade)
Write notes in-app or pick an existing .txt or .docx file—StuDie turns it into a clean, printable PDF using Android’s native PdfDocument.

⚠️ Image support in DOCX isn't fully working yet—images currently disappear into the void (fix in progress).

🎙 Speech to Text
Record your voice and convert it into editable text. Great for lectures, quick notes, or when your hands are just too lazy to type.

🖼️ Background Remover
Remove the background from images—perfect for IDs, presentations, or any clean cutout you need.
Currently supports human-only segmentation using ML Kit's Selfie Segmentation (offline!).

🔮 Coming Soon...
🧠 Flashcard Generator
Generate smart flashcards directly from your notes or documents—perfect for quick reviews.

📅 To-Do List + Calendar Integration
Organize tasks, exam schedules, and deadlines—all in one synced view.

🤖 Offline AI Study Buddy
Talk to a smart assistant that works offline. It’ll help you review, explain concepts, and even chat like a virtual study partner. No Wi-Fi? No problem.
