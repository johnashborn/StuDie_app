📚 StuDie — Your Student Buddy App

Hey there! 👋  
StuDie is a personal side project I'm working on to make student life a little easier. Think of it as your academic buddy—packed with useful tools to help you study smarter, not harder, cuz we hate that do we? haha



Anyways, here are the current features👇👇


🚀 Current Features

📸 Camera Calculator  
Snap a photo of a math problem and let the app do the thinking. It uses OCR to read the expression and solves it using `exp4j`. Fast, simple, and kinda magical and it still amazes me how it worked.

📄 DOCX/Text to PDF Converter (to be upgraded)\n
Write your notes or pick an existing file—StuDie turns it into a clean PDF in seconds using Android’s built-in `PdfDocument`. Handy for assignments, reviewers, or anything else. But if your document has a picture, it won't 
convert it into pdf but instead it will vanish into the void.



🔮 Coming Soon...

Here’s what’s cooking:

🎙 Speech to Text  
Record your voice and turn it into editable text. No typing needed.

🧠 Flashcard Generator  
Automatically create study flashcards from your documents or notes.

📅 To-Do List + Calendar Integration  
Keep track of tasks, exams, and deadlines—all in one place.

🤖 Offline AI Study Buddy  
A smart assistant you can talk to—works offline, helps you review, and mimics a real-time convo like a virtual study partner.



🛠 Tech Stuff

• Built with Java in Android Studio  
• Uses XML for the layouts and design
• OCR for text recognition (camera calculator)  
• Android’s native PdfDocument for PDF generation  
• Version control via Git + GitHub

Let’s build something awesome for students, by a student.
